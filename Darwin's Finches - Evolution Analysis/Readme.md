## Darwin's Finch Beak Evolution Statistical Analysis

For the past 40-plus years (from 1973 to 2013), [Peter and Rosemary Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Rosemary_Grant) visited the Galápagos island of Daphne Major and collected data on [Darwin's finches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin's_finches), to study Darwin's theory of evolution.

The Grant's spend years observing, tagging, and measuring Darwin's finches and their environment. During that time they documented environmental changes and how these changes favored certain individuals within the population, illustrating natural selection in action.

The dataset focuses on finches beak dimension. For the finches, the size and shape of their beaks are traits that vary to adapt the environmental changes. The relationship between beak size and ecological events which has been somewhat popularised as being an example of ‘[evolution occurring before our eyes](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/The_Beak_of_the_Finch.html?id=-bbh3c4ezP0C&redir_esc=y)’.

We have compared Darwin's finches beck length and depth measurement collected in 1975 with 2012's data. The changes in the beck's dimension in these 37 years, helps us derive evolution in the particular species.

For our affirmation, to prove evolution, we have used statistics method like bootstrapping, parameter estimation and hypothesis test.
